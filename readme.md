Temperature Estimation via Impedance and a 2-D Thermal Model 
============================================================

<img src="GraphicalAbstract.png" width="775">

This repository contains the Matlab source code to appy an Extended Kalman Filter to monitor the 2-D temperature distribution of a 32113 lithium iron phosphate cell using single frequency electrochemical impedance measurements. 

An accompanying paper for this code entitled
"On-board monitoring of 2-D spatially-resolved temperatures
in cylindrical lithium-ion batteries: Part II. State estimation via impedance-based temperature sensing"
has been submitted for publication in the Journal of Power Sources.
A preprint for this paper will be made available on [arxiv.org][1] shortly. 

This code accompanies the following paper:
Robert R. Richardson, Shi Zhao, David A. Howey, [On-board monitoring of 2-D spatially-resolved temperatures in cylindrical lithium-ion batteries: Part II. State estimation via impedance-based temperature sensing][5], Journal of Power Sources, 2016.

I would ask that you cite this paper if you want to use this code for 
your own research.
Note that Part I of this paper derives the thermal model used here. That paper is available [here][6] and its accompanying code available [here][7].

This code has been developed at the Department of Engineering Science of the University of Oxford.
