Temperature Estimation via Impedance and a 2-D Thermal Model 
============================================================

<img src="GraphicalAbstract.png" width="775">

This repository contains the Matlab source code to appy an Extended Kalman Filter to monitor the 2-D temperature distribution of a 32113 lithium iron phosphate cell using single frequency electrochemical impedance measurements. 

An accompanying paper for this code entitled
"On-board monitoring of 2-D spatially-resolved temperatures
in cylindrical lithium-ion batteries: Part II. State estimation via impedance-based temperature sensing"
has been submitted for publication in the Journal of Power Sources.
A preprint for this paper will be made available on [arxiv.org][1] shortly. 

I would ask that you cite this paper if you want to use this code for your own research.
This code has been developed at the Department of Engineering Science of the University of Oxford.
